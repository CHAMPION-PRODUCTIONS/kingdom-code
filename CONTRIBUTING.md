# kingdom-code_contributions

Do you have an idea for the _Kingdom Code_ project? That is awesome! Please, use the guidelines that
follow to give your suggestion the best chance to be accepted in the least amount of time:
#
### _Standardized_
* If you want to apply a small fix or patch to a feature that already exists, keep it simple, and
  include a test.

* If you have a new feature in mind, again, keep it simple. If necessary, divide it into smaller parts to
  facilitate the review. Include documentation and a test for each phase of user interaction, if any.
  Otherwise, a simple test for functionality is fine as long as these guidelines are followed.

* If your contribution changes the utility's behavior significantly, make simplicity a priority,
  include tests, documentation, and updates for application documentation.

* Please, submit small pull requests. The easier the proposed change is to review, the more likely 
  it will be merged.

* In the pull request, describe the proposed change, and the reason these should be made. Plus, 
  include any tasks left to finish.
#

Once you have your work configured for the project, you tested dependancies, and it runs, use the workflow 
that follows for the most conventional way to proceed:

#

* Fork the project.
* Clone down your fork  (  `git clone git@github.com:<username>/kingdom-code.git` ). 
* Create a topic branch to contain your change (`git checkout -b my_awesome_feature`).
* Perform tasks, add tests, and find your happy place.
* Make sure everything still passes.
* If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.
* Push the branch up (`git push origin my_awesome_feature`).
* Create a pull request against champion-productions/kingdom-code and describe what your change
  does and the why you think it should be merged.
# 

note: for these procedures, the repo is configured to give the contributer a lot of control
in case someone is more knowledgable and has a better process than standard. i'm open.
