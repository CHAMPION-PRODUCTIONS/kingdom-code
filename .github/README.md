## Welcome to Kingdom Code!

### Project Overview:
#
This project was inspired by a symbolic language nearly lost to time.
The aim is to expose this information to the user through a simple search of the onboard directory.
When the user clicks on the search box, they are presented with preloaded words. They can choose one to get started.
If a word search is successful, it returns the word searched for, a word universally symbolic to it, and a source that varifies the connection.
For example, if the user enters the word, 'arm,' the return display would look similar to the one that follows:

            W O R D           |        K E Y W O R D              |                   S O U R C E                                                
         ____________         |      ______________________       |        ______________________________________
                              |                                   |                       
              arm             |           strength                |  Psalm 1:9 "Something about how the arm is strength."

### Project Outlook:
#
The potential in this data is Earth-moving. Because at the core of this information is the encryption used for all of scripture. Plus, the
information held within a matured database collection can solve all the ancient mysteries! As they were disgisuised within this symbolic tongue.
The value of this data can not be overstated. This devise works great for learning, research, and a literary tool.

If the user could select two words, 'bow' and 'arrow,' for example:

>
            W O R D           |        K E Y W O R D              |                   S O U R C E                                                
         ____________         |      ______________________       |        ______________________________________
                              |                                   |                       
              bow             |           tongue                  |  Proverbs 4:22 "Something about how the bow compares to the tongue."
             arrow                        lie                       Proverbs 9:19 "Like arrows, lies are shot from the bow."

In addition, there is an excellent opportunity here for machine learning, as it is unique, as valuable. The current database was manually gathered by the
same logical process a program would use but a machine could cut out the margin of error that exists in Human misinterpretation, and gather the data at a much faster rate.
